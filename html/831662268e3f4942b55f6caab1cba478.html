You need to configure the required logic.<br /><br /> <b>Part 1: Understanding the operation of AI and AO function block</b><br /><br /> Step 1: First <b>left click</b> on AI block available under IO tab. Drag this block to required position preferably left side and vertically at center.<br /> 2. Now <b>left click</b> on AO block. Drag it and put it next to AI block.<br /> 3. Take the cursor to the color dot at the output side of AI block. Move it by <b>left clicking</b> and take it to the color dot at the Input side of AO block.<br /> 4. Now click on Compile tab. If any compilation errors are there, it will be shown. Otherwise Run tab gets activated. <br /> 5. When user clicks on Run tab, default value of AI will get displayed on wired connection.<br /> To change the input value and observe the output change, <b>right click</b> on the AI block. Select edit and enter an input value in the range 0-100. You will observe the change at the AO block output.<br /> When you click on the block, the properties of the block gets displayed at left hand bottom corner.<br /> To delete the connection, <b>click</b> on the wire <b>question mark</b> at the output side of the block and press delete key.<br /> Other options like delete, disable and configure are available on <b>right clicking</b> the block. For modifying the logic, user need to first press Stop tab and enter into Configure tab.<br /> For clearing the workspace, Clear tab is available.<br /><br /> <b>Part 2: Understanding the operation of DI and DO function block</b><br /> Follow same procedure as above to get the bolcks in the workspace and connect DI and DO blocks. In RUN mode, change the digital input value to 0 from1 or vice-versa and observe the effect.<br /><br /> <b>Part 3: Understanding the operation of Logic function block</b><br /> To configure the logic circuit, first reload the page by clicking <b>Clear</b> tab<br /> 1. First <b>left click</b> on digital input (DI) block to get it in the workspace. Repeat this procedure for getting 2 DI blocks. They will be by default DI1 and DI2. Similarly get 1 DO block in the workspace.<br /> 2. <b>Left click</b> on any logic function block e.g. AND function from Logic Tab available in the left hand panel.<br /> 3. Connect output of DI1 to one of the inputs of AND block.<br /> <b>Initially only one input connection is available with the logic block. As you make DI connection with this input, another connection appears for this logic block.</b><br /> Connect DI2 output to this second AND block input. Connect output of AND block to input of DO.<br /> 4. Now click on Compile tab. If any compilation errors are there, it will be shown. Otherwise Run tab gets activated. <br /> 5. Now change one of the inputs to AND gate by toggling DI value from 0 to 1. Observe the DO status.<br /> 6. Change another input to AND gate in the similar manner and observe DO status.<br /> 7. Verify the AND gate truth table by changing DI status. <br /> Similarly verify the truth tables for OR and NOT Logic Gates.<br /> </span></p>
