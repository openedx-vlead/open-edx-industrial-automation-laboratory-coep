<h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Part 1: Understanding the operation of On Delay Timer and Off Delay Timer<br /><br />1. From the panel at left side, click on IO tab and click on DI. <br /><br />2. Use left click and drag the DI block at center location in the workspace.<br /><br />3. Take TON block available under TIMERS tab by clicking on it. Put this block next to DI block.<br /><br />4. Next to TON block, take DO block to observe On delay timer operation. Follow the procedure mentioned in step 1.<br /><br />5. Connect the output of DI block to input of TON block and output of TON block to input of DO block.<br /><br />6. Rightt click on Timer block and configure it. Enter required&nbsp; delay (preset value by which the output is to be delayed) in terms of milli seconds.&nbsp; e.g. For a delay of 1 second, require preset value is 1000.<br /><br />7. When configuration is done, click on Compile tab to activate the Run tab. Run the logic now.<br /><br />8. To start the Timer operation, Change the DI value. You need to toggle the input value by using right click.<br /><br />9. Observe the accumulated timer value. When it becomes equal to preset value, the timer output and the Do block output is set to 1.<br /><br />10. Change the DI value to 0 again and observe the output status.<br /><br />11. To observe the operation of off delay timer, first click on Stop tab. Go to compile mode. You need to replace the TON block with TOFF Timer block. <br /><br />12. Right click on TON block. Select and delete the block.&nbsp; Form panel, select TOFF block available under Timer tab.<br /><br />13. Repeat steps 5 to 9. <br /><br />The output of Off delay timer is set to 1 without any delay, when DI is set to 1. But when DI is changed back to 0, the timer operation starts, delay is provided and the output is changed to 0 or Off state.<br /><br />Part 2: Understanding the operation of Up and Down counter<br /><br />1. To configure the counter circuit, first reload the page by clicking Clear tab.<br /><br />2. Refer step 1 mentioned in part 1 to drag&nbsp; DI block.<br /><br />3. From the panel, click on COUNTER; click on UP, to select Up Counter block. Put this block next to DI block.<br /><br />4. Next to UPCTR block, take DO block to observe Up Counter operation. Follow the procedure mentioned in step 2.<br /><br />5. Connect the output of DI block to input of UPCTR block and output of UPCTR block to input of DO block.<br /><br />6. Rght bclick on the UPCTR block to configure. Enter required count (preset)&nbsp; value after which the output is to be set. <br /><br />7. When configuration is done, click on complile tab to activate Run tab.<br /><br />8. To understand the counter operation, Change the DI value by toggling. You need to use right click for this.<br /><br />9. Observe the accumulated count value.<br /><br />10. Change the DI value to 0 again and observe the output status.<br /><br />11.&nbsp; Repeat step 8 to 10 till the accumulated value becomes equal to preset.<br />When accumulated value becomes equal to preset, the counter output and the Do block output is set to 1.<br /><br />12. Do not forget to drag and drop Reset block available under Counter tab to restart the counter.<br /><br />13.&nbsp; To observe the operation of down counter, go back to compile mode by pressing Stop tab.&nbsp; Now replace the UPCTR block with DWCTR counter block. <br /><br />14. Right click on UPCTR block. Select delete and delete the block.&nbsp; From the panel, select DOWN block available under Counter tab.<br /><br />15. Repeat steps 5 to 11. <br /><br />In case of down counter, the preset value is loaded in accumulator when the simulator is taken to Run mode. On<br />every transition of input from 0 to 1, accumulated value is decremented by 1. When accumulated value becomes<br />equal to 0 the output of counter is set to 1.</p>
