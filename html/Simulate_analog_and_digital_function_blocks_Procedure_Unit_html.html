<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>Click on the link provided under simulator tab to open the simulator. You need&nbsp; to configure the required logic.<br /><br />Part 1: Understanding the operation of AI and AO function block<br /><br />&nbsp;Step 1: First left click on AI block available under IO tab.&nbsp; Drag this block to required position preferably left side and vertically at center.<br /><br />&nbsp;2. Now left click on AO block. Drag it and put it next to AI block.<br /><br />&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Take the cursor to the color dot at the output side of AI block. Move it by left clicking and take it to the color dot&nbsp; at the Input side of AO block.<br /><br />&nbsp;4. Now click on Compile tab. If any compilation errors are there, it will be shown. Otherwise&nbsp; Run tab gets activated.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;5. When user clicks on Run tab, default value of AI will get displayed on wired connection.<br /><br />To change the input value and observe the output change, right click on the AI block. Select edit and enter an input value in the range 0-100. You will observe the change at the AO block output.<br /><br />&nbsp;When you click on the block, the properties of the block gets displayed at left hand bottom corner.<br /><br />&nbsp;To delete the connection, click on the wire question mark at the output side of the block and press delete key.<br /><br />&nbsp;Other options like delete, disable and configure&nbsp; are available on right clicking the block. For modifying the logic, user need to first press Stop tab and enter into Configure tab.<br /><br />&nbsp;For clearing the workspace, Clear tab is available.<br /><br />Part 2: Understanding the operation of DI and DO function block<br /><br />Follow same procedure as above to get the bolcks in the workspace and connect DI and DO blocks. In RUN mode, change the digital input&nbsp; value to 0 from1 or vice-versa and observe the effect.<br /><br />Part 3: Understanding the operation of Logic function block<br /><br />&nbsp;To configure the logic circuit, first reload the page by clicking Clear tab<br /><br />&nbsp;1. First left click on digital input (DI) block&nbsp; to get it in the workspace. Repeat this procedure for getting 2 DI blocks. They will be by default DI1 and DI2. Similarly get 1 DO block in the workspace.<br /><br />&nbsp;2. Left click on any logic function block e.g.&nbsp; AND function from Logic Tab available in the left hand panel.<br /><br />&nbsp;3. Connect output of DI1 to one of the inputs of AND block.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially only one input connection is available with the logic block. As you make DI connection with&nbsp; this input, another connection appears for this logic block.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect DI2 output to this second AND block input. Connect output of AND block to input of DO.<br /><br />&nbsp;4. Now click on Compile tab. If any compilation errors are there, it will be shown. Otherwise&nbsp; Run tab gets activated.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;5. Now change one of the inputs to AND gate by toggling&nbsp; DI value from 0 to 1. Observe the DO status.<br /><br />&nbsp;6. Change another input to AND gate in the similar manner and observe DO status.<br /><br />&nbsp;7. Verify the AND gate truth table by changing DI status.<br /><br />Similarly verify the truth tables for OR and NOT Logic Gates.</p>
